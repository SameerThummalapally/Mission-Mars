# Mission-Mars

Created a model which predicts the type of plants we can grow at different geographical regions so that maximum number of plants would survive from the given plants dataset.Performed exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing and prepared it for predictive modeling. Classified the model predictions with KNN, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector machines employing Hyperparameter Tuning and compared those models based on performance KPIs, training and testing accuracy in order to determine final predictive model recommendation
